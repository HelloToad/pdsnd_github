Introduction:
This project is part of Udacitys program "Programming for Data Science with Python". It is designed to parse through the bike sharing data of three major cities - Chicago, New York City and Washington.
Before showing any kind of data, the user is being asked for which city and timeframes he/she wants to filter for.

How to Use:
Run the application using Python and the terminal will promptly ask for user input. Depending on the input the raw data will be filtered/computed.
It is possible to yield information about:
- most common month/day of week/hour of day
- most common start station/end station/trip from start to end
- trip durations (travel time/average travel time)
- see raw data

Files:
Each .csv file contains information about [Start Time | End Time | Trip Duration | Start Station | End Station | User Type | Gender | Birth Year]
for each trip that occurred in one city (Chicago/New York City/Washington). The file for Washington doesn't contain any information about Gender and Birth Year.

Application:
The application was coded using Python, Numpy, Pandas.

Used Resources:
The Python Standard Library
Pandas Documentation
